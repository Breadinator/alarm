A python program to make alarms and timers.

## Tutorial
new alarm <alarm name> <time (format: YY/MM/DD/dd/mm)> - Creates an alarm to finish at the time given. MM = month; mm = minute.
new timer <timer name> <time in seconds (format: ssssssss) - creates a timer in seconds.
help - shows the help menu
quit - exits the program

#### Examples
new alarm An alarm's name 17/08/04/23/10

## Plans
- Add sounds for the completion of alarms and timers.
- Make the threading work nice together.
